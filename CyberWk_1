For the past week I have been diving down a rabbit whole with cyber security and networking.  There is a lot to learn and instead of me feeling like I am in over my head I am turning towards a kid in the candy store.  I wanto to try everything and keep going till big brother tells me to stop.  One thing I do know is that I have to know what speciality I want to do, i.e. pentester, soc analyst, etc.  But I am leading towards Red team or penetration tester.  I feel that I am more of an offensive player.  I will keep going and learn everyday!!!
